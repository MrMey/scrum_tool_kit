# scrum_tool_kit

## Motivation
A large number of websites offer solutions to help you manage the Agile Scrum ceremonies. Great, but have you checked the General Conditions of these websites. You may be surprise to discover under which laws fall your data.

I may be over-paranoiac but I feel like these websites could represent a major flaw that could be used for social engineering. It allows to discover who are in the same teams and get some insights on the company. The motivation is to offer a secured peer-to-peer solution that offer solutions for the Scrum ceremonies but ensures privacy.

## Summary
